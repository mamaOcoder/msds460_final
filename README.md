## Project Summary
The digital gaming industry faces the challenge of optimizing server capacity to accommodate fluctuating player numbers, a crucial factor affecting player satisfaction and retention. This study focuses on the discrete event simulation of the gamer engagement life-cycle, specifically the process of logging into a gaming system under server capacity constraints. This paper presents our methodology, which involves modeling gamer behavior in response to queue times, including decisions to balk or renege. Utilizing a combination of queueing theory and discrete event simulation, we constructed a model that provides insights into managing server load and enhancing the gaming experience. Through our simulation, we offer management recommendations aimed at optimizing player engagement and minimizing the adverse effects of server capacity limits.

In this term project, our aim was to develop a discrete event simulation focusing on a critical aspect of online gaming ecosystems: the gamer engagement lids-cycle. Initially, our ambition was to model the comprehensive user life-cycle for a subscription service, tracking the transition from prospective users to various stages of engagement, including power or at-risk statuses, ultimately impacting churn rate. However, the complexity of modeling the entire user journey and challenges in applying queueing theory led us to narrow our focus. We pivoted to specifically simulate the dynamics of gamer login processes, where server capacity constraints necessitate a queueing system for access. This simulation offers insights into gamer behavior in response to wait times or queue lengths, including the decisions to balk or renege. By presenting the modeling methods, results and deriving management recommendations, this paper contributes to understanding and optimizing the gamer engagement process, with implications for server management and overall user experience enhancement.
